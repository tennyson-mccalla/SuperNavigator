  "longDescription": "SuperNavigator combines Navigator's context engineering (92% token reduction) with Superpowers' TDD workflows into a layered architecture. OS Layer provides session management, Theory of Mind, and Loop Mode. App Layer delivers brainstorming, systematic debugging, code review, and parallel development. Both layers communicate via shared .agent/ data store with implicit integration. Local-first with plugin-ready structure.",
